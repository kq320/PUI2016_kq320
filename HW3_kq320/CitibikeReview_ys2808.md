comments: it would be more reasonalbe if the tripduration is divided into several category rather than compare the mean of two genders directly.

suggestions: divide the trip duration into catogories like: 0-200,200-400,400-600,...

suggested statistical test: Chi square

explanation: independent variables: 1, data type: categorical; dependent variables:1 , data type: categorical
